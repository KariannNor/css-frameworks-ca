- Profile page (/profile/index.html)

The authentication page should have a form to login or register to the application. Ensure to include HTML form validation and use /profile as the action attribute. Password must have a minimum length of 8 characters.

The feed page should have a list of posts thumbnails, a search bar, sort options and a form to create a new post. You may add additional design features beyond these requirements.

The profile page should have a profile image, username, list of user posts, follow button and an area to display following/followers.

There is no requirment for JS functionality beyond Bootstrap UX behaviour. For example, using the provided dropdowns, tabs or carousel is acceptable but there is no further requirement for custom JS.
